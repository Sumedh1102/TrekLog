# TrekLog
TrekLog is a React.js-powered travel journal app where I document my travels. It dynamically showcases places Iâ€™ve visited, detailing locations, dates, descriptions, and map links. Using props and the map() function, the app efficiently renders travel cards, making it a great hands-on project for mastering React fundamentals.
